EX01:
    The goal of this exercise is to implement the most basic function
    pointer's use. Store the "print_nb" function in a pointer and execute
    it with the value 5. The return must be the display of the value 5.

Tips:
    If you haven't read the ex00, read it.
    Don't forget : a function pointer stay a pointer (it's just more 
    precise synthax)

                            /!\ WARNING /!\
This exercise will allow you to get used to function pointers. There will be
a more useful example in the next two exercises !

void print_nb(int nb)
{
    printf("%d\n", nb);
}

int main(void)
{
    return 0;
}
