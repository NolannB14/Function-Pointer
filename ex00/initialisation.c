What's a pointer ?

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. It is
very useful in C programming and can store any type of variable.

What's a function pointer ?

Like normal data pointers, a function pointer store a memory adress BUT this
address is link to a function. So it means that we can execute this function
throught his pointer.

How to declare a function pointer ?

    int (*ptr)(int) = &adress;
     |     |    |        |
     1     2    3        4

1 -> return of the function stored
2 -> name of the pointer (variable)
3 -> arguments of the function stored
4 -> function's adress
