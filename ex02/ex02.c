EX02:
    The goal of this exercise is to call a function of your choice in an
    intermediate function which will control and handle the execution of the
    other. Calling a function throught another is called a callback and can
    be useful in C.

    An example of this type of call is the function signal/sigaction. You give
    to it a function that will be called when a signal is received.

Tips:
    - Search on google "what's a callback function" to understand what it means.
    - Think about a means to put a function pointer in a function parameter.
    - The code may be editable

A callback may be useful to separate your function execution during the program
execution. However, the callback system is more efficient when it is combine with
an array. See EX03 (when you finish this one of course).
